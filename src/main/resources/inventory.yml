# Welcome to the Inventory Config file, your place to edit the entire '/punish' inventory!
# Below is an example of what it should look like, you can add as many entries as you like,
# as long as it matches your inventory menu size. (This can be changed in the 'settings.yml')
# If you have questions about how to use this file, please don't hesitate to PM me (_ItsShadow_)
# on Spigot or on Discord (ItsSchatten#0013).
# Here is the 1.13 Material list. https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

example: # The name does not matter! It can be anything actually.
  # Everything below must be the same in yours, if it isn't named the same it will not work.
  item: DIAMOND_BLOCK # What item should be displayed. (Using 1.13 API)
  where: 23 # Where in the menu it should appear. (Max is the Max size of your inventory.
  amount: 1 # How many of the item should appear? (Max is 64.)
  glow: true # Should we apply a glow effect to the item?
  name: "&7Permanent Ban" # What should the name of the item be?
  # If you want a multi-line lore you must use Scalar. (I suggest looking into it.)
  lore:
    - '&eBan Duration &7Â» &c&lPERMANENT'
    - ''
    - "&dSomething else :D"
  commands: # What commands should be executed when the item is clicked?
  - ban {player} {reason} # If 'use-conversations' is false in the 'settings.yml' file the {reason} placeholder will not work.
  - whisper {sender} Well done!
  permission: 'punishgui.use' # You can set a permission here if only want specific players to be able to use the item.
  close-on-click: true # Should we close the menu when the player clicks this item?
