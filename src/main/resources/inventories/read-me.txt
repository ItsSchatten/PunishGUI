Hey there! You've found yourself into the brand new inventory system. If you ever delete the default inventory file or this file, you can go to
https://github.com/ItsSchatten/PunishGUI/tree/master/src/main/resources/inventories/ to see the default files.

You can also delete the "inventories" folder and both files will be regenerated.

To create a new inventory file, simply copy and then paste the inventory.yml file.

If you want to create one from scratch the file must contain the following keys:

permission: "yourPermissionHere"
priority: 1 # This must be a value greater than 0. Users that have multiple permissions to use an inventory will have their highest priority inventory opened.
name: "YourNameHereWithColorCodes Use {target} to get the target's name."
size: 27 # 9-54 must be a multiple of 9.
