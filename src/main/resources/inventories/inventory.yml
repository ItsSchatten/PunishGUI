# Welcome to the Inventory Config file, your place to edit the entire '/punish' inventory!
# Below is an example of what it should look like, you can add as many entries as you like,
# as long as it matches your inventory menu size. (This can be changed in the 'settings.yml')
# If you have questions about how to use this file, please don't hesitate to PM me (ItsSchatten)
# on Spigot or on Discord (Schatten#4113).
# Here is the latest Material list. https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

# It should be noted that you can not have an inventory with less than 9 spaces, an inventory of more than 54, or an inventory that contains slots that are not a multiple of nine.

# This is required for the file to be considered valid, if your file lacks this or the priority key there will be an error sent in console.
permission: punishgui.use

# Users that have multiple inventory permissions (this is NOT recommended), the inventory with the highest priority will be used
priority: 1

# The name that will appear for the inventory.
name: "You are punishing {target}"

# The size of the inventory.
size: 27

permban:
  type: COMMAND # There are three types. COMMAND, CONSOLE, and NONE. Command and Console require a section named 'commands' to be a sibling to type.
  item: DIAMOND_AXE # The item that will appear in the inventory.
  name: "&cPermanently Ban" # The name of the item. This is not required, but it will set the materials name as the name of the item.
  lore:
    - '&7Permanently ban the target.' #  The lore of the item. This is not required, it will set an empty list to the lore however.
  amount: 1 # This is not required, you can remove this section entirely.
  where: 12 # Where the item will be loaded into the inventory.
  commands: # As mentioned above the types of COMMAND or CONSOLE require this to be a sibling to the type entry. You can specify any commands here, as long as the sender has permission to execute the command you should be good.
    - '[message]&cPlayer {target} has been permanently banned for {reason}.'
    - 'ban {target} {reason}'
    # We've added some new things that can be added to commands! You can add [message] to send a message to the opener of the inventory,
    # or you can add [console] to run a command as console. (This is useful if you need to run multiple different commands to make sure that a punishment is executed properly.
  permission: '' # This doesn't need to be here, if there is one set you must enable permission items in the 'settings.yml'
  close-on-click: true # This is required, if true the inventory will be closed when a player clicks on the item, otherwise it won't close. It may close based on what commands are executed however.
kick:
  type: CONSOLE # See above.

  name: "&7Kick"

    - '&7Kick the target.'
